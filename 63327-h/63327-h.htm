<p class="title">CHATTERTON.</p>

<h2 class="scene">SCENE.</h2><p class="setting">&mdash;A Garret in Brooke Street, London.  Casement at back C. opening
on the street; door, L. 3. E.; rough bedstead R. of window; rude chairs
and table, with candle, manuscripts, and writing materials on it, L. C.;
old washstand, on which are a glass, a basin, and a broken jug of water,
R. 2. E.  The Garret is in the house of Mrs. Angell, and is the lodging
of the Poet Chatterton.  It is the night of August 24th, 1770.  Music
on rise of curtain.  A distant bell is heard tolling the hour.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  [<i>Knocking from without</i>.]  Mr. Chatterton!  [<i>Knocking</i>.]
Mr. Chatterton!  [<i>Knocking</i>.]  Mr. Chatterton!</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Angell</span> <i>with lamp.  Lights up.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Chatterton, a gentleman&mdash;[<i>Looking around</i>.]  Alack! the boy is out.
[<i>Places lamp on table, and goes back to door</i>.]  Come in, sir.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span> <i>and</i> <span class="character">Bertha</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Chatterton is not in.  Will you wait, Mr.&mdash;, Mr.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Pompously</i>.]  Mr. de Burgum, Madam.  I trust that I shall have
a more honorable title soon;&mdash;eh, daughter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  There is no more honorable title, father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Bah! romantic.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  He surely will return soon: he is seldom out in the
evening.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  I'll await his coming.  I must see him on a matter connected
with the de Burgum Pedigree, which he was fortunate enough to discover.
I say "fortunate enough," since otherwise some one else would have
discovered it&mdash;birth, like murder, will out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  Pray be seated, sir.  [<span class="character">Burgum</span> <i>sits</i> R. <i>of table</i>;
<span class="character">Bertha</span>, L.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Looking around the room</i>.]  The rewards of poetry, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  The rewards of poetry, father, only poets know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Another romantic speech!  If you must worship a poet, worship
my collateral ancestor, Master John de Bergham, a Cistercian monk, one
of the greatest ornaments of his age&mdash;so the Pedigree reads&mdash;and a
translator of the Iliad.  This boy never can be a poet: he knows no
Latin and Greek.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  He is not writing Latin and Greek.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  I regret that I permitted you to come.  You are a sentimental
girl likely to fall in love with such a vagabond as Chatterton.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Do not call him a vagabond, father: you owe so much to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  For what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Your Pedigree.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  He has been paid.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Yes&mdash;a crown.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Hem!  He shall have more after the College of Heralds has
passed upon my claims&mdash;not before.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  In the meantime he may starve.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  Indeed, lady, he is starving now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Nonsense!  One-half the troubles in life are due to gorging.
Besides, I heard before we left Bristol that he had sent his mother some
china and dress patterns&mdash;even British herb-tobacco and a pipe for his
grandmother.  Starving?&mdash;nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  That was over a month ago, sir.  Then he always was
telling of what he was going to do for his mother; but now he seems so
hopeless, and still he writes so hopefully to her.  I do not believe he
has had a morsel of food these two days.  He is too proud to take
anything from me.  He says he is not hungry, and yet he looks almost
famished.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Poor Chatterton!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Why does he not work?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  He does work, sir&mdash;all night sometimes&mdash;writing, writing,
writing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  I mean at something profitable&mdash;looking up pedigrees, for
instance,&mdash;the boy has a genius for pedigrees.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  I believe he is trying to get an appointment as a
surgeon's mate.  My husband, good man, offered to secure him a place as
a compter; but Mr. Chatterton stormed about the house.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  A poet's gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  A poet's indignation 'gainst a clown.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  My husband is no clown, lady.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  I beg your pardon, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Angell</span>.]  Pay no attention to her:
she is as crazy as Chatterton.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  I would I were.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Bah!  You are half in love with the beggar already.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  If he had a chance, sir, I think he would make something
great.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  I am sure of it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  You never met him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  But I have seen him, and have read his poems.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  That doggerel in the "Town and County"? [<i>Taking a paper from
table</i>.]  Here is more of it.  [<i>Glances at paper</i>.]  What's this?
[<i>Reads</i>.]</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"Gods! what would Burgum give to get a name<br />
  And snatch his blundering dialect from shame?"</p>
</div>

<p>The ingrate!</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p class="i1">"What would he give to hand his memory down<br />
  To time's remotest boundary&mdash;a crown.<br />
  Would you ask more, his swelling face looks blue;<br />
  Futurity he rates at two pounds two."</p>
</div>

<p>Zounds! this of a de Burgum&mdash;a descendant of Simon de Seyncte Lyze, a
companion of William the Conqueror!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  Be not angry with him, sir; he is not like one of us.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Chatterton</span>, <i>who pauses near doorway</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Thank heaven for that!  I will not longer brook<br />
The impudence of this ungrateful boy,<br />
Who mutters, rants, and doth himself opine<br />
One of the brooding darlings of the world.<br />
By what right is he moody and revengeful?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  He is as nature made him: full of pride<br />
And fierce resentment 'gainst a callous race.<br />
Give him but patience to endure neglect&mdash;<br />
Quell his rebellious spirit, and you take<br />
From his tossed soul God's gift of poesy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Coming forward</i>.]<br />
Lady, were I the poet of my dreams,<br />
Instead of Chatterton, I could not word<br />
My gratitude to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>'Tis Chatterton!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Well, Burgum, what's the news?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Aside</i>.]  <span class="s12">&nbsp;</span>Impertinence!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Chatterton</span>.]<br />
Be seated, sir; you must be very tired;<br />
You have not been at home since ten o'clock.<br />
The day&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Sinking upon a chair</i>.]<br />
    <span class="s5">&nbsp;</span>Clouds, sunshine, rain&mdash;I'll sleep to-night.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  Is there not something I can get you, sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Ah, yes: go purchase me another heart;<br />
The world has worn this out&mdash;'tis like my shoes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  When through with business you must dine with us:<br />
I have some sheep tongues I would have you try.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  What use are sheep tongues when I needs must roar?<br />
I'd eat a lion's litter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  [<i>Aside</i>.]  <span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>O, how strange!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  [<i>Aside</i>.]  The boy talks very wildly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Impatiently</i>.]  <span class="s10">&nbsp;</span>Madam, go!<br />
You'd make a helpless invalid of me.  [<i>Exit</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Angell</span>.]<br />
She is a noble woman and a bore.<br />
Now, Norman blood, what's wrong in Bristol that<br />
Brings you to town?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s5">&nbsp;</span>Let us be serious, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  First let me borrow Lord North's goggle eyes,<br />
And have the modish stare: my fiery orb<br />
Disquiets men of birth.  Go on, go on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  My pedigree&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s5">&nbsp;</span>Should antedate the flood:<br />
I'll read your partner's brother's silly book<br />
On the Noachian Deluge, and report<br />
What I can glean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Aside</i>.]  <span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Did I not need his help,<br />
I'd cane the rogue.  [<i>To him</i>.]  I've brought my quarterings<br />
And pedigree that you did kindly trace<br />
To be examined and attested by<br />
The Herald's College.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Aside</i>.]  <span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>George!<br />
He'll find 'tis all a hoax!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>They have them now.<br />
I must solicit you to go with me,<br />
And answer certain questions.  I'll pay you well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Not for the wealth of Soho Square, my lord.<br />
I am the Duke de Garret: they must come<br />
To interview me here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>Impossible!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Then let them nose among their dusty tomes<br />
To solve the riddles.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Indignantly</i>.]  'Tis an outrage, sir!<br />
I am a lineal descendant from&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Laughing</i>.]  I copied that, and know it all by rote.<br />
Your ancestor, in reign of Henry Sixth,<br />
Obtained a royal patent to transmute<br />
All the inferior metals into gold;<br />
And now, while George the Fat squats on the throne,<br />
You, by that charter, deal in pewter, sir.<br />
From gold to pewter&mdash;'tis a fearful fall;<br />
And yet you glory in it.  O for shame!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Remember that my daughter's here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s14">&nbsp;</span>Forgive me.<br />
If I could aid you, I do vow I would,<br />
But 'tis beyond my power.  [<i>Aside</i>.]  I do regret,<br />
For her sweet sake, I played the prank.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s13">&nbsp;</span>Well, well;<br />
I fear your going would not further me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Aside</i>.]  You'll learn that soon enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Taking coin from purse</i>.]  <span class="s7">&nbsp;</span>Here is a shilling;<br />
Your landlady asserts you are in need.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>In anger</i>.]  'Tis false!&mdash;a lie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s14">&nbsp;</span>Well, Bertha, was I right?<br />
And, Chatterton, I'll give you this advice.<br />
You eat too much or too irregular.<br />
A much disordered stomach is a rot<br />
From which young imps, bred like to maggots, rise,<br />
And pester sore the brain.  Could I destroy<br />
The miseries by bad digestion blown,<br />
I'd be the benefactor of the age&mdash;<br />
Yea! of all time.  The world is gone astray:<br />
Your melancholy bard o'erloads his paunch,<br />
And thinks it is poetic pregnancy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Few poets have a chance to overfeed.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Angell</span>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  O father, you are cruel.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span>.]  <span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>Pardon, sir.<br />
There is a gentleman below, who says<br />
He must see you at once.  Shall he come up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  No, no: I'll go to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  <span class="s8">&nbsp;</span>I'll tell him so.<br/>
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Angell</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  He may bring news about the Pedigree.<br />
[<i>To</i> <span class="character">Bertha</span>.]  Wait here; I shall return.  [<i>Exit</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Going to table</i>.]  <span class="s3">&nbsp;</span>Fair advocate,<br />
For your defence my thanks must be the fee.<br />
You come from Bristol&mdash;is my mother well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  I really do not know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s8">&nbsp;</span>No, no, of course:<br />
My head is heavy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s5">&nbsp;</span>O, you do need aid!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Perhaps; yet more I need another mind<br />
That turns not giddy on this whirling sphere.<br />
But that is naught to any one save me&mdash;<br />
Who cares for Chatterton?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s8">&nbsp;</span>There's one at least:<br />
One who beheld him roam the Bristol streets<br />
Beset by dangers of a forward youth&mdash;<br />
Misunderstood, unhappy; one who knows<br />
All that he must have suffered here from want,<br />
From loneliness, and hopes unrealized;<br />
One who for him will offer up her prayers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Have mercy, lady, do not make me weep.<br />
You do not know me: I am harsh indeed.<br />
I have a most unlucky way of raillery,<br />
And when the fit of satire is upon me,<br />
I spare not friend nor foe.  Your father's duped.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Why then we shall be happier; so 'tis well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Part of this wretchedness that seethes within<br />
Is due to damned, unconquerable pride,<br />
And part from hot imagination flows.&mdash;<br />
My brain's afire.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s4">&nbsp;</span>I pity you the more:<br />
Imaginary woes are real to him<br />
Whom they oppress, and hardest to dispel;<br />
And if you truly do deserve your fate,<br />
Then have you more to bear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s7">&nbsp;</span>You came in time;<br />
To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow might have been too late.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  My father soon will come, and I would ask&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  My life, and it is yours.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s12">&nbsp;</span>No, not your life;<br />
But that you nobly live.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s5">&nbsp;</span>I'll try, I'll try.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Give me some token; let it be a verse<br />
In your own hand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s3">&nbsp;</span>I have none worthy you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Have you not one among your papers there?<br />
I know 'tis much to ask.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s5">&nbsp;</span>No: it is yours.<br />
[<i>Taking up a sheet of paper</i>.]<br />
On melancholy&mdash;that will scarcely do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Read it to me, and I shall be the judge.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Reads</i>.]</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p><span class="level1">When silent are the chambers of the mind</span><br />
    <span class="level2">To rippling laughter and to whispering love.</span><br />
    <span class="level2">When Hope hath whirred away, a mourning dove,</span><br />
  <span class="level1">And bats dart in and out, and moans the wind,</span><br />
  <span class="level1">Then Melancholy comes, to night consigned,</span><br />
    <span class="level2">And haunts the moonlit windows.  Perhaps above,</span><br />
    <span class="level2">Not on this earth, can shadowy thoughts that rove</span><br />
  <span class="level1">Like troubled ghosts a sweet oblivion find.</span></p>

  <p><span class="level1">O like some cindered orb that shineth not,</span><br />
    <span class="level2">Yet holdeth still its planets as a sun,</span><br />
  <span class="level1">Is one burnt out by sorrow and o'erfraught</span><br />
    <span class="level2">With that mute anguish of a life undone&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="level1">That sinking of the heart, that deadly thought</span><br />
    <span class="level2">That all is lost and would be worthless won.</span></p>
</div>

<p>[<i>Handing paper to her</i>.]  I would that it were better.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s18">&nbsp;</span>'Tis so sad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  I wrote it on the midnight of the day<br />
I fell into a new-made grave.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s9">&nbsp;</span>O, sir,<br />
Yield not to gloom; for you are rich in mind.<br />
Of all the boons the Fates propitious grant<br />
I'd choose the golden branch of poesy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Each man doth pay a price for what he has.<br />
The very qualities of mind and heart<br />
That make a poet make a sufferer.<br />
The keenness of perception, which unfolds<br />
A realm of beauty hid to other eyes,<br />
Unmasks the world: shows him indifference<br />
Behind the flimsy guise of courtesy,<br />
The shallowness of friendship, the alloy<br />
Of self, debasing charity to trade.<br />
The vividness of his imagination,<br />
Which, in a garret, gives him trees and flowers,<br />
The cool salt sea and heaven's blue expanse,<br />
Enlarges troubles, and creates such fears<br />
He trembles at the possible in life.<br />
The sensibility, which treasures up<br />
Each word or look of kindness as a gem,<br />
Makes bitterer the haughtiness of birth,<br />
The vulgar swelling of a pompous purse,<br />
The slur, the slight, the mockery of fools.<br />
Beyond he sees a spiritual sphere,<br />
Where, by unselfishness, the terrible<br />
Becomes a valued teacher&mdash;where the power<br />
To wound through self is lost; yet cannot reach it.<br />
He is a medium through which all things speak:<br />
The human passions wrack his nervous frame;<br />
Each thing in nature makes his heart its pulse.<br />
Who would aspire to wear the laurel crown?&mdash;<br />
It is a crown of thorns!  [<i>Sinks back upon chair</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  O you are faint from hunger!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s11">&nbsp;</span>'Tis not so:<br />
A giddiness&mdash;be not afraid&mdash;'t will pass&mdash;  [<i>Faints</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  [<i>Going to him and raising his head</i>.]<br />
O Chatterton, look up!  He's dead!  He's dead!<br />
O world, behold your deed!  His eyelids move!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Recovering</i>.]<br />
'Tis gone.  O I would die to wake like this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  I'll get a glass of water.<br />
[<i>Goes to washstand and brings water back</i>.]<br />
<span class="s14">&nbsp;</span>Here, drink this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>After drinking</i>.]<br />
I have these spells&mdash;they are not serious.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  Fly!  Mr. Burgum swears he'll murder you&mdash;<br />
He is enraged.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>I would fly only one<br />
Who had the power to extend my lease of life:<br />
I am aweary of the premises.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  He's foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s12">&nbsp;</span>Then let him foam.<br />
Each petty wave upon the mighty sea<br />
Foams at its pleasure&mdash;why not he?  I say<br />
Then let him foam.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span> <i>in a fury</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Waving his cane</i>.]  I'll murder him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Chatterton</span>.]  <span class="s9">&nbsp;</span>Come away!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Nay; he is harmless as a bottled bee:<br />
He can but buzz.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span>.]  What is the matter, sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  That knave! that knave!&mdash;the pedigree is false!<br />
What can you say, you villain?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s10">&nbsp;</span>He is ill.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  I care not for his illness, let him speak!&mdash;<br />
You swindler, speak!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>You gave him but a crown.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  Peace, peace; or I shall drive you from the room.<br />
[<i>To</i> <span class="character">Chatterton</span>.]  Now answer me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>Rising</i>.]  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>Were it not for your age<br />
And for your daughter whom I do respect,<br />
I'd answer not in words.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s7">&nbsp;</span>O Chatterton!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  O gentlemen, I beg you both forbear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Bertha</span>.]<br />
Have no fear, lady; did he bear a knife<br />
To stab me here, I would not parry it,<br />
If by such action I should frighten you.<br />
Stand not between.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s5">&nbsp;</span>In King's Bench you shall lodge!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  Then I shall fatten at the town's expense.<br />
Now, look you, Burgum, I'll no more of this,<br />
Unless the lady bid me, so take heed.<br />
This room doth show my poverty and needs,<br />
Yet 'tis my castle, sir!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>I am undone;<br />
And Bristol will clap hands upon her sides<br />
And roar with mirth.  Why did you dupe me so?&mdash;<br />
'Twas not for money, for 'twas but a crown.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  'Twas not for money, or you should have paid<br />
A thousand crowns.  You will remember, sir,<br />
That when a pupil at the Bluecoat School,<br />
Poor, lonely, friendless, with a thirst for lore,<br />
I came to ask of you the loan of books,<br />
You mocked my poverty, jeered at my verse,<br />
And sneering bade me learn the cobbler's trade.<br />
I knew your passion was for gold and birth;<br />
And gold you had.  In bitter sport<br />
I wrote your pedigree, scarce thinking it<br />
Would be received with credence; yet it was.<br />
I should have told you then, but you did swell<br />
And treat me with disdain.  I tell you now<br />
That, since you are the father of this girl,<br />
I'd give my life to undo what is done;<br />
Yet, were you not her father, I do swear<br />
I'd give my life to do it o'er again.<br />
I made a fool of gold, for it had made<br />
A fool of me so long.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>The whole is false:<br />
My ancestor was not of Norman blood,<br />
And John de Bergham never lived at all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  He habited a world within a world&mdash;<br />
This globe of fancy, where strange creatures live,<br />
And all the business of existence moves<br />
Unrecked of, as though on some distant orb.&mdash;<br />
Thank heaven! that, being a poet, he dwelt not here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Despairingly</i>.]  What shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Chatterton</span>.] <span class="s7">&nbsp;</span>Can nothing be contrived<br />
By which my father may derision 'scape?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span>, <i>after a thoughtful pause</i>.]<br />
You are not known in London; what is done<br />
Will ne'er to Bristol come: you can give out,<br />
Anent the pedigree, 'twas all your joke.<br />
Play your cards slowly, and with that same tact<br />
With which you bargain for your tin and lead;<br />
And, sir, the game is yours.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Chuckling</i>.]  <span class="s3">&nbsp;</span>To turn the laugh<br />
Upon the laughers&mdash;good&mdash;that is the trick.<br />
Come, daughter, come.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Angell</span>.  <span class="s4">&nbsp;</span>'Tis dark: I'll go before.<br />
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Angell</span> <i>followed by</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Good-by.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s3">&nbsp;</span>O lady, when I said good-by<br />
To my dear mother on the cloudy night<br />
I took the coach for London, I did feel<br />
As though that word were fully charged with grief;<br />
But 'twas not so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  <span class="s4">&nbsp;</span>O, sir, do not despair;<br />
And should we never meet again, believe<br />
My thoughts will ever wander back to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  We shall not meet again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Burgum</span>.  [<i>Calling from without</i>.]  <span class="s3">&nbsp;</span>Come, Bertha.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  [<i>To</i> <span class="character">Burgum</span>.]  <span class="s14">&nbsp;</span>Yes!<br />
[<i>To</i> <span class="character">Chatterton</span>.]  Why so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s6">&nbsp;</span>If Barrett recommend me strong,<br />
I sail for Africa as surgeon's mate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  Indeed!&mdash;but then you will return.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chatterton</span>.  <span class="s13">&nbsp;</span>Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bertha</span>.  I will not say good-by&mdash;good-night.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
